These are some of my solutions to [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) coding problems.

The problems are a few of the easier ones that take about five minutes to solve.  I do them
to try to learn a little bit of Python. As such, the code probably is not great from a
Python perspective, often times calculating simple things that are already in the language.

In most cases, the algorithms are brute force, so they are not very efficient.  Still, even the
brute force algorithms execute in under a minute, which is fine for practical purposes.

Generally the solutions are supposed to be secret, but a Google search comes up with many hits,
so I don't feel too compelled to hide the code.  Obviously, these are spoilers if you want to
solve them yourself.
